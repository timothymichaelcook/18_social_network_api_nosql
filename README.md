# Social Network API

Project Repo: [Github-repo](https://github.com/timothymichaelcook/18_social_network_api_nosql)

## Description

The focus of this project was to create an API for a social media web application where users can create a friend list, share thoughts as posts (similar to Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and react to the thoughts of friends (similar to Facebook and Slack).

## User Story

```
- AS A social media startup
- I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
- SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Installation 

Packages:
Express
Mongoose

Commands:
mysql -u root -p
source schema.sql
npm i
node server.js

## Usage

Users need to import the following npm packages: express and mongoose. Run npm i to install these packages. Users need to enter the database and source the schema files. Once sourced, the user needs to be in the root directory of the project and run node server.js to start the application. In Insomnia, users can test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes will be for viewing users and thoughts. POST and DELETE routes will show user's friends list and reactions to thoughts.
